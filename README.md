# 🌍 Analysing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Using Tableau

<p align="center" style="font-style: italic; color: #555;">
  This project was completed collaboratively by the team.

## 📌 Project Overview

Analyzed and visualized Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) data using Tableau by performing data integration, storytelling analysis, comparative regional performance evaluation, forecasting, and dashboard creation. The project also includes reflections on sustainability, business continuity, and Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) to provide deeper insights into the data.

## 👨‍💻 My Contribution (Suraj):

You played a technical data engineering role, ensuring:

- ✅ Correct merging of datasets (via UNION)  
- ✅ Cleaning and preparing the data (especially dealing with null values and standardizing fields)  
- ✅ Creating pivot-ready datasets for streamlined visualisation

## 🗂️ Datasets Used

- **SDG Index Data (2000–2022)**
- **Sustainable Development Report (2023)**

These datasets were **merged using the UNION operation** in Tableau, ensuring no data duplication and full integration of available metrics.

The merged dataset was further enhanced through:
- `Calculated Fields` for handling missing values
- `Pivot Transformations` for multi-dimensional analysis

# ## 🔍 Key Insights

- **OECD countries lead SDG performance**, especially in Goals 1 *(No Poverty)*, 3 *(Good Health and Well-being)*, and 7 *(Affordable and Clean Energy)*, due to strong policy frameworks, investment capacity, and robust data infrastructure.

- **Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most challenged region**, consistently scoring lowest on the SDG Index. However, a gradual upward trend since 2015 suggests growing policy attention, international aid, and localised efforts to improve SDG outcomes.

- **COVID-19 and global economic disruptions** significantly impacted progress, especially on health (Goal 3) and poverty (Goal 1). Countries with strong healthcare and social safety nets recovered faster, reinforcing the need for resilient systems.

- **Forecasting (2024–2034)** using Tableau indicates that while OECD and East Asia & Pacific regions are expected to continue progressing steadily, regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia may fall short of 2030 targets without accelerated interventions.

- **Regional disparities are evident in climate-related goals.** Europe and North America show higher transition rates to clean energy (Goal 7), while others lag due to limited infrastructure and policy gaps.

- **Policy strength and data governance matter:** Countries with clear national strategies, reliable data systems, and proactive governance structures consistently perform better in SDG progress.

- **Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)** remain persistent global challenges. Marginalised groups in many developing regions still face systemic barriers in accessing education, healthcare, and clean energy, hindering broader SDG attainment.

- **Collaborative efforts are critical:** Achieving the SDGs requires coordinated action between governments, private sectors, NGOs, and civil society, especially in addressing cross-cutting issues like climate change, poverty, and health equity.
